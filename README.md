## *Description*
This is a Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS quiz app. I created a bank of questions in the `questions.json` file and imported them into the `quiz.py` file. Ten randomly selected questions will be asked from the bank of questions. The user will be prompted to answer each question and will be given a score at the end of the quiz. The user can also view the correct answers to the questions they answered incorrectly.
<br>

***Question and answer bank was AI generated. I found 2 errors during my build process. Please excuse any inaccuracies.***

### ***Some notes about the Python json module:***<br>
 - The json module allows you to encode (serialize) Python objects into JSON format and decode (deserialize) JSON data into Python objects.<br>
 - json.dumps() is used to convert a Python object into a JSON string representation.<br>
 - json.loads() is used to parse a JSON string and convert it back into a Python object.<br>
 - The module supports pretty printing of JSON data for better readability using the json.dumps() function with the indent parameter.<br>

### ***Some notes about the Python random module:***<br>
 - The random module in Python provides functions for generating random numbers, selecting random elements, shuffling sequences, and other random-related operations.<br>
 - random.sample(list, k): Returns k unique random elements from a list (10 unique `questions` were selected in the following code snippet)<br>
